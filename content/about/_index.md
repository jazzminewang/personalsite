Hi! I'm Jasmine. I'm a technologist and philosopher, sometimes both at once.
I currently work at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as a researcher on the policy team, and have previously done engineering and research for [Lyft self-driving](https://self-driving.lyft.com/), and [Microsoft Research's Tech for Emerging Markets group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/technology-for-emerging-markets/). 

I like thinking about, learning, and practicing machine learning, philosophy of science, scifi, poetry, and classical music. Recently, I've been thinking about human-machine augmentation, metascience, trust in the face of collective action problems, and utopia. 

For the next few months, I'll travelling around the world learning how different people are thinking about how to manifest beautiful, fulfilling futures for us as a species, reading [a book a day](https://reading.supply/post/4ad4c85c-3181-4c89-84ff-d6b383e0666d), and trying to write something coherent about it all.  

I'm grateful to be supported during this exploration phase by several organizations: [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/awards/) for conceptual work on creating an alien language, the [Centre for Long Term Priorities](http://www.longtermpriorities.org/) to study China-relevant macrostrategy, and [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergentventures) to read, think, and learn from people about how to make the world fantastically better. 

To be notified when I post + receive fun artifacts I discover along the way, subscribe to my [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/jasminewang). I generate shorter artifacts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/j_asminewang) and cache personal thoughts on [reading.supply](https://reading.supply/@jasminewang).
