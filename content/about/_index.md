Hi! I'm Jasmine. I'm a technologist and philosopher, sometimes both at once.
Most recently, I was working at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as a researcher on the policy team. 

I like thinking about, learning, and practicing machine learning, philosophy of science, scifi, poetry, and classical music. Recently, I've been thinking about human-machine augmentation, metascience, trust in the face of collective action problems, and utopia. 

For the next few months, I'll travelling around the world learning how different people are thinking about how to manifest beautiful, fulfilling futures for us as a species, [reading](https://reading.supply/post/4ad4c85c-3181-4c89-84ff-d6b383e0666d), and trying to write something coherent about it all.  

I'm grateful to be supported during this exploration phase by the [Centre for Long Term Priorities](http://www.longtermpriorities.org/), [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergentventures), and [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/17/examining-ais-effect-on-media-and-truth/) to read, think, and learn from people about how to make the world fantastically better. 

Earlier versions of myself did engineering and research for [Lyft self-driving](https://self-driving.lyft.com/), and [Microsoft Research's Tech for Emerging Markets group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/technology-for-emerging-markets/), and were supported by engineering, research, and academic fellowships most notably by Interact, Kleiner Perkins, 8VC, Microsoft, and the Fulbright Foundation. I am also a classically trained, now defunct, pianist (it'd significantly improve my life to have more musician friends-- please say hi!); music represents much of what is inspiring about the world to me.
